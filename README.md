###### Munnar
Munnar is so perfect for a bike ride and solo trip . What makes the spot special is its soothing climate and natural charm. **Camping and tenting** in Munnar is a great experience.  **Sunset at Lockhart Gap** is so beautiful and also it is offering the most amazing **panoromic view of Western ghats**.
